# Todo-CLI
I know this is not at all useful, but this is my first CLI application. I need to showoff(Sorry, showcase my skills).

#How to use it
First, clone it yaar
Second, chnage the directory to Todo-CLI.
Third, use it by command node index.js help

You will face an error. I knew it, because you didnot even install node packages. How come?

Third, install node packages using npm install
Fourth, use it by command node index.js help

Done
